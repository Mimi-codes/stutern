    <h1>MY FAVORITE MEAL (AMALA)</h1>
    <p class="origin">Àmàlà is a local indigenous Yoruba food, native to the Yoruba ethnic group of South-Western Nigeria. It is made out of yam and/or cassava flour, or unripe plantain flour.Tubers of yams are peeled, sliced, cleaned, dried and then blended into flour. It is also called èlùbọ́. Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried which gives àmàlà its colour. It is a popular side dish served with ewédú and gbẹ̀gìrì (black-eyed beans soup), but is also served with a variety of other ọbẹ (soups), such as ẹ̀fọ́, ilá, and or ogbono.</p>

    <h4>HOW TO PREPARE</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Cover and boil water till it starts making bubbles. </li>
    <li>Lower the heat to a bare minimum and add the yam flour into the water all at once and then stir/turn with wooden spoon or spatula (omorogun) till it comes together but it won't be smooth at this stage. This process takes about a minute.
        <strong>Note that number one mistake most people make is stirring and adding yam flour little at a time. That method will make the amala lumpy. Instead, put in all the yam flour first before stirring.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Add the reserved 1 cup of water to the Amala using the wooden spoon to create well in the middle and sides and leave the water to steam the amala for 1-2 minutes.
   <strong>Don't keep the Amala on heat for too long or it will become stretchy. The whole process from when you pour in yam flour till end should be roughly about 4-5 minutes.</strong></li>
</ol>
